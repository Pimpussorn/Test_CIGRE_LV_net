# Test_CIGRE_LV_net
This is an initial project for learning how to use CIGRE net. 
file CIGRE_LV_network.py contains functions in which CIGRE net is created, loads assigned at the chosen residential nodes and results logged.
file CIGRE_time_series_separate.py is where the data input is imported and run_timeseries() called.
